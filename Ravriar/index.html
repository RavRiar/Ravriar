                            <p> While transitioning to a new position in the Marine Corps, this "plaque" was designed specifically to my 
                            personality and my ability to keep the work environment easygoing, interactive, and highly productive. </p>

                            <p>After my military services, I worked at Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Yes, like the show on the TV, just, 
                            a whole lot more real. It was a great learning experience and made great connections. I was presented this when I 
                            decided to leave in pursuit of a career in Software Development world! </p>

                            <p>While in the Marine Corps, I also held the title of Black Belt Martial Arts Instructor. I volunteered to teach others in the 
                            military the proper fundamentals and techniques in order to better themselves and pass on the knowledge.</p>

                            <p>Out supporting the local San Diego breweries in the annual San Diego Brew Festival with some good friends. San Diego is known
                               to have a lot of local events as such that allow you the opportunity to interact and see what is going on in San Diego! </p>

                            <p> Cannot forget one of the most important hobbies of all time, working out! The gym and I get disconnected every now and then, 
                            but this is one relationship that will go all the way!!

                            <p>One of my passions is to get out there, travel, and experience everything I can! This is my visit to Seattle where I got lucky 
                            and caught a Seattle Sounders FC soccer game! </p>

                            <p>One of the beautiful sights of Southern California. While people always desire to visit Southern California, I am grateful that 
                            for the past 5 years I've had the opportunity to live here in beautiful San Diego County.
